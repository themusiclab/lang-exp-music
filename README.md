## Anatomy of the repo

Upon first downloading this repository, you should run the `data_downloader.R` script in the home directory. This will download all the required data (from https://zenodo.org/record/7614189#.Y-LAp-xBz0p) and move it to the correct locations.

After you have done this, to render the paper, run the code in `/writing/manuscript.Rmd`.
\

`/data` contains all the data: 

- `/Exploratory` contains the exploratory datasets: exploratory pre-exclusion data (`Explore_full.csv`), exploratory post-exclusion data (`Explore_filtered.csv`), exploratory one-to-one matched data (`Explore_matched.csv`), and exploratory inverse-probability weighted data (`ipw_explore.RData`). 

- `/Confirmatory` contains the confirmatory datasets: confirmatory pre-exclusion data (`Confirm_full.csv`), confirmatory post-exclusion data (`Confirm_filtered.csv`), confirmatory one-to-one matched data (`Confirm_matched.csv`), and confirmatory inverse-probability weighted data (`ipw_confirm.RData`)
- Language features and classification (`language.csv`)
- Headphone check scores (`headphone_scores.csv`)
